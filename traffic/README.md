For the nueral network, I first followed the lecture. I put the same settings for the network as the convolutionaal nueral network in the video. with 128 nuerons in the hidden layer i get a .05 accuracy. Then I started trying out different things. With 250 neurons i get a .92 accuracy. So it is much higher. Then I tried sigmoid activation for the hidden layer and it went from .93 accuracy to .057 so that didnt work. I added a second hidden layer so one had 250 nuerons and the second one had 128 nuerons and the accuracy dropped to .92 instead of .93. i added more max pooling layers and it dropped the accuracy to .79. Next instead of 250 nuerons i tried 400. I then got .95 accuracy whitch is better but it took much longer and made my computer very laggy while it was running. It seems if i add more nuerons it has a better accuracy but it has diminishing returns for how much computer power it needs.
